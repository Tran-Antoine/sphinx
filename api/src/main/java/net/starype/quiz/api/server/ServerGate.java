/**
 * An immutable connection between a server and a game object.
 * <p>
 * The main purpose of {@code ServerGate} is to provide a simple way for any quiz game to update the server when needed.
 * Server gates can be generated using {@link GameServer#createGate()}, then configured with {@link #withGame(QuizGame)}.
 * <p>
 * Since the {@link QuizGame} object is the one containing the gate, in most cases it will
 * configure the server with itself as the reference for the game object that will interact with the server in the future.
 * <p>
 * However, it is sometimes useful to configure the gate with a different type of game than the one creating it (typically in
 * an inheritance context), therefore game call backs should <strong>always</strong> use the lambda parameter provided (which is
 * nothing but the configured object) instead of {@code this}. For instance, {@link SimpleGame} contains
 * a default implementation for every required method, however, if one wishes to extend it for their own implementation, they might
 * want to work with a {@code GameServer<MySimpleGameExtension>} rather than a {@code GameServer<SimpleGame>}. In this case, the gate
 * should be created as a {@code ServerGate<MySimpleGameExtension>}. So it is important that {@code SimpleGame} does not use itself
 * as a reference for game call backs (but rather use the lambda parameter), otherwise working with a {@code ServerGate<MySimpleGameExtension>} will not be possible.
 * @param <T> the type of {@code QuizGame} the server works with
